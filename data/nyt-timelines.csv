"463765807","Nate_Cohn","Same story, but for those following at home the most recent counties to wrap up have been a bit better for Espy, but he's basically still looking at mid-single digits at best, if Jackson/Delta turnout proves stronger than what we've seen from majority black areas so far https://t.co/4f3CazpWo2","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","And here's a quick look of what we've seen RE: turnout so far. Not much out of majority black counties, but none of it is keeping up with the more robust returns from white areas https://t.co/el38jeGb7t","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","And as the turnout picture shapes up, Espy appears to run even farther behind his 'true' targets than the ALSEN based targets we started with. Mid-single digits with an ALSEN-like turnout can quickly turn into an 8 point defeat or worse if the turnout picture isn't so favorable","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","In general, CHS enjoying a stronger turnout in white areas than Roy Moore did, but Espy not as obviously getting a higher turnout than Jones in black areas (though fewer black counties completed).
Probably relatedly, CHS also running ahead of an ALSEN baseline in white areas",NA,NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","And looking at the big picture, you get the same thing. Espy just generally not quite hitting what he'd need to get over the top https://t.co/DZWeB74A6m","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","Now we're up to 7 completed counties. Generally representative.

"463765807","Nate_Cohn","We have two more completed counties--polar opposites: Tishmingo (white, Appalachia) and Coahoma (Delta, 70% black).

Coahoma is right in line with a ALSEN-based est for a tie, but Tishmingo stronger for CHS both in terms of turnout and support","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA
"463765807","Nate_Cohn","We do have two completed counties now, though: Benton and Amite. 
Very small counties, but collectively the result there is right on line with the target for a tied race, though I'll note that elsewhere in the state CHS is generally running ahead of the target https://t.co/IOq9tVQfr5","Nate_Cohn",NA,NA

"463765807","Nate_Cohn","Still nothing at 100%, but updating this chart it does seem pretty hard to find anywhere far along in the county where Espy is really beating the 'target'

"463765807","Nate_Cohn","The other thing I'd note, though, is that the 'target' I'm using here is mainly based on the Alabama Senate race.

"463765807","Nate_Cohn","Taking the broader view besides Warren/Desoto, I'd still argue that Espy is running a few points behind his targets.

"463765807","Nate_Cohn","As far as I'm concerned, we're basically in wait and see mode until we get a handful of completed counties.
